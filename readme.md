# Intercom Activity Submission

## Problem üåç 

We have some customer records in a text file (customers.txt) -- one customer per line, JSON lines formatted. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).

## Installation instructions üë©‚Äçüíª 
The project is written in **python 3**. Please follow the below instructions to install Python on your machine.

## Let's talk about the Project Structure üìÑ 
- The project contains a **main.py** file that acts as the entry point to the program.
- There is a sample **customers.txt** file that is used to read the customer data.
- The output generated is stored in a separate **output.txt** file. 
- The Project contains a **services** folder.
- All the logic related to reading/writing to the files can be found inside **input_output_service.py**
- All the logic related to calculating the distance between the customer and the Intercom office can be found inside **customer_invitation_service.py**
- There is a separate **tests** folder that contains the code related to running the Unit Tests.
- **test.py** contains all the unit tests logic.
- Unit tests have their own input/output files which can also be found inside the **tests** folder.


## Unit Tests are important. Let's see how we can run them üë©‚Äçüè´ 
Make sure that you are in the root **/intercom** folder.

Try running the below command to run the Test Cases
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test.py
```
Here, **tests** is the directory where all the test cases and the corresponding input/output files are present.   
**test.py** is the actual file that is being executed. 


## It's time. Let's run the program üíª .

The project has a sample **customers.txt** file which will be used to read the customer data.

Make sure that you are in the root **/intercom** folder.   

Run the below command to execute the program.
```bash
python main.py
```
Stay with me, let's look at the output üòÉ   
Check the **output.txt** file to look for the desired output.
